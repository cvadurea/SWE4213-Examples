# GitHub Activity 
The goal of this activity is to make sure that you are comfortable working with github.

## Part 1: Create your own GitHub repo 
This repo is where you are going to store all of your activity code. Note that this will be part of your participation mark. 

1) Create a github repo named `SWE4213-Activites`
2) In VSCode initialize your repository and create a README.md file with your name.
3) Commit and push your changes to your repo. 
4) Add a collaborator (`eeddy`). This will allow me to monitor your repo. 

## Part 2: Clone my repository of examples 
1) Form my repository: https://github.com/esquaredanalytics/SWE4213-Examples.git 
2) Clone the forked repository locally: `git clone https://github.com/<username>/SWE4213-Examples.git`
3) Create a new branch off of main.
4) Update the README.md to include your name. Commit the change and push your branch.
5) Create a pull request from your new branch on your remote to `esquaredanalytics/main`.
